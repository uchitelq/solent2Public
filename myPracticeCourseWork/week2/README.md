## Set up
1. remember to set up maven as we did in week1
2. create a new 'week2' folder under your myPracticeCouseWork folder.
3. copy the contents of week2 into this folder and modify or add to the code here as needed. (NB only change any code in myPracticeCouseWork).

## Exercise 1 factoryAndFacade

In this exercise you will look at Java Collections and Generics, complete a simple factory method and implement and create tests for a simple facade interface. 
You will then look at how to generate skeleton code from UML class diagrams in Netbeans.
Finally you will look at a more complex example which completely seperates the client from the implementation classes.

Try the  [factoryandfacade](../week2/factoryandfacade) exercises.
